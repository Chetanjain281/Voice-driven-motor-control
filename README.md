#Voice Driven Motor Controller
Welcome to the Voice Driven Motor Controller project repository!

About
This project aims to create a motor controller that can be controlled using voice commands. It utilizes Arduino and voice recognition technology to achieve this functionality.

Description
This Arduino code allows you to control motor devices via voice commands using the SinricPro library. The code sets up Wi-Fi connectivity, initializes relay pins, and establishes communication with the SinricPro cloud service.

Features
Control multiple devices using voice commands.
Utilizes the SinricPro library for seamless integration with voice assistants.
Supports Wi-Fi connectivity for remote control.
Getting Started
To get started with this project:

Upload the provided Arduino code to your Arduino board.
Configure the Wi-Fi credentials and SinricPro API keys in the code.
Connect the necessary components as per the circuit diagram.
Power on the system and initiate voice commands to control the motor(s).
Configuration
WIFI_SSID and WIFI_PASS: Set your Wi-Fi credentials.
APP_KEY and APP_SECRET: Obtain API keys from the SinricPro website.
Configure device IDs and GPIO pins for relays and switches according to your setup.
Usage
Once configured, the motor controller can be controlled using voice commands through a compatible voice assistant linked to the SinricPro service.
